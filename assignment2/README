# CSCI 360 Assignment 2 - CPU Process Scheduler

This application simulates different CPU process scheduling algorithms using the C programming language. It demonstrates how a list of tasks, each with a given name, arrival time, priority level, and burst time, would be executed by a CPU using various different process scheduling algorithms including:
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority (PR)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Priority Round Robin (PR-RR)

Note: There are no actual processes being executed, the "execution" is simulated by printing out the task and how much time the CPU executed it.

## Technologies

This application has been developed using the C programming language. This application can be built and run on a system with a GCC compiler. Unix make utility is necessary to build as well as recommended to run the application. 

This application has been tested on Debian 12 (Linux) with GCC 12.2.0.

## Build and Installation

To build this application from the source code enter following command from the root directory of this application.

	>make

To clean the files from the previous build of the application enter following command from the root directory of the application.

	>make clean

There is no installation script to install this application automatically. However, you can manually install this application by copying the executable file (any of the sort files) from the 'bin' subdirectory of this application to a system directory, for example, '/usr/local/bin', that is listed in the '$PATH' environment variable of your system. You need system privileges in order to copy the executable into your target directory.

## Usage

You can run the application using the First Come First Server (FCFS) scheduling algorithm by entering the following command.

	>make run-fcfs

You can run the application using the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm by entering the following command.

	>make run-sjf

You can run the application using the Priority scheduling algorithm by entering the following command.

	>make run-priority

You can run the application using the Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm by entering the following command.

	>make run-rr

You can run the application using the Priority Round Robin scheduling algorithm by entering the following command.

	>make run-priority-rr
